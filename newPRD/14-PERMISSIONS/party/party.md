# Permission matrix — Party

*This document is generated. Edit `_model/capabilities/party.yaml`, not this file.*

Permission is evaluated as **Action + Entity + Field + Scope**, in that order. A denial at any layer stops evaluation. Field-level denial removes the field from the response payload entirely (`E_AUTHZ_FIELD`) so a client cannot distinguish *hidden* from *empty*. Scope denial returns `404`, not `403`, so the existence of out-of-scope records is never confirmed.

> **GAP — default grant per (role archetype x verb x scope) is not declared in the model — this matrix must be filled before any pack can ship working permissions**  
> Not specified in the model. This is a task, not an omission to be papered over. Owner: TBD. Blocks: implementation of `party.permission_defaults`.

## Field-level gates

| Field | Gate verb | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `legal_name` | `view_sensitive` | held separately because invoices, contracts and statutory filings need the legal name while every screen needs the trading name |
| `primary_phone_e164` | `view_sensitive` | marked in model |
| `primary_email` | `view_sensitive` | marked in model |
| `tax_registration_id` | `view_sensitive` | jurisdiction-specific registration number. Nullable because an unregistered counterparty is normal and refusing to record them would push the work into a spreadsheet |
| `identity_document_kind` | `view_sensitive` | for a person, which kind of identity document was verified |
| `identity_document_ref` | `view_sensitive` | a reference to the stored document through the evidence_capture port, never the document number itself. Storing a national identifier in a searchable column is how a breach becomes a catastrophe |
| `identity_verified_at` | `view_sensitive` | marked in model |
| `credit_limit_minor` | `view_financial` | marked in model |
| `payment_terms_days` | `view_financial` | marked in model |
| `risk_flag` | `view_financial` | blocked prevents new commitments but never hides history |

## Scope vocabulary in force

| Scope | Resolution |
|---|---|
| `own` | `subject_id == principal.id` |
| `own_team` | `subject.team_id IN principal.managed_team_ids` |
| `own_site` | `subject.site_id IN principal.assigned_site_ids` |
| `own_region` | `subject.site.region_id IN principal.managed_region_ids` |
| `own_department` | `subject.department_id == principal.department_id` |
| `own_customer` | `subject.customer_id IN principal.linked_customer_ids` |
| `own_vendor` | `subject.vendor_id IN principal.linked_vendor_ids` |
| `tenant` | `subject.tenant_id == principal.tenant_id` |
| `platform` | `principal.tenant_bound == false` |
