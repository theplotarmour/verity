# prematurely." All three stages share one base so the Prisma client
# `prisma generate` writes in the builder stage is binary-compatible with
# the runner stage that executes it — building on the host and copying in a
# host-built .next/standalone would NOT be portable (verified locally: a
# Windows dev build produces `query_engine-windows.dll.node`, useless here).

# BUILD-TIME vs RUNTIME, made explicit (see taskplans/30_containerized_runtime.md §"Build-time vs runtime configuration"):
#
# NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables are inlined into the browser bundle BY `next build`
# — there is no "runtime" for them, Next.js's own architecture requires the
# real value here. Neither is a secret: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY is
# designed for exactly this exposure (protected by Postgres RLS, not by
# secrecy — see .env.example's own comment on it).
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
# Placeholders when unset, for the same reason DATABASE_URL has one below:
# `next build` imports every route module to collect page data, and
# `config.ts` validates the Supabase variables at import time when the auth
# provider is `supabase` (its default). An OIDC-only deployment (Task 36) has
# no Supabase project at all, and without these defaults its image could not be
# built — the boundary would be real in the code and fictional in the package.
#
# Harmless: these are inlined into the browser bundle, and a deployment that
# actually uses Supabase must pass the real values as build args, exactly as
# before. An unusable placeholder fails loudly at sign-in rather than silently
# authenticating against something.
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=${NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL:-https://build-placeholder.invalid}
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=${NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY:-build-placeholder-anon-key}
# Same reasoning, one layer deeper: `config.ts` also requires a cookie-signing
# secret, which on a Supabase deployment falls back to the anon key and on an
# OIDC one must be set explicitly. `next build` needs *a* value to import the
# module; the deployment needs a real one.
#
# This cannot leak into the runtime image: `runner` starts from `base`, not
# from `builder`, so no ENV set here survives into the image that serves
# traffic. The running container is given the real value by compose, and a
# deployment with none is refused by `deploy/security/preflight.sh` before it
# ever starts.
ENV VERITY_SESSION_SECRET=${VERITY_SESSION_SECRET:-build-placeholder-session-secret-not-used-at-runtime}

# DATABASE_URL is NOT inlined anywhere — it is read from `process.env` only
# when the running server actually needs it. But `src/server/platform/config.ts`
# validates it as non-empty at module import time (Task 26), and `next build`
# imports every route/layout module during "Collecting page data" to build
# the route manifest — confirmed locally: every route in this app renders
# dynamically (ƒ), so this import happens for all of them. A syntactically
# valid placeholder satisfies that check without needing real credentials
# at image-build time; the real value is supplied at `docker run`/Compose
# time below and overrides this one, since it is never baked into any file.

# WHY THIS STAGE EXISTS — found empirically, not designed in advance.
#
# The `runner` stage below contains only `.next/standalone`: the traced subset
# of node_modules, the server entrypoint and static assets. That is correct for
# a runtime image and it is precisely why `npx prisma migrate deploy` cannot run
# in it — the Prisma CLI is a devDependency, `prisma/migrations/` is not copied,
# and `npx` in an offline container cannot fetch either.
#
# Task 42's migrate.sh and bootstrap.sh were written against `web`, and the
# containerized acceptance run is what surfaced it. The fix is a separate stage
# with the full dependency tree and the schema, used by those two scripts and by
# nothing that serves traffic: the runtime image stays minimal, and the
# migration path stops depending on a container that was deliberately stripped.
