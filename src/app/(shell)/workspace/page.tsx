 * Workspace (§11).

 * reading, a workspace is for executing. So this is a queue of things awaiting
 * this actor, not a set of metric tiles. Every item links to where the work is
 * done.
 *
 * It shows only what the platform can genuinely answer today — approvals awaiting
 * the actor's role, unresolved sync exceptions, and blocked records. There are no
 * SLA warnings because no SLA engine exists yet, and inventing one here would be
 * a fake workflow.
