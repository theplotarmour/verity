/**
 * Creates a login for a member of staff.
 *
 * REQUESTED: "instead of inviting someone, make it such that the owner makes a
 * login for them."
 *
 * `invite_person` provisioned a Party, a User and a membership against a
 * RANDOMLY GENERATED auth id — a person who existed in every list and could
 * never sign in, because no Supabase account had that id. For a five-person
 * yard where the proprietor hands out the passwords, an invitation flow is
 * ceremony around a thing they were going to do themselves anyway.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS AN ACTION AND NOT A COMMAND. Creating an auth account is a write
 * to Supabase Auth, which is not the tenant database and not inside the
 * command's transaction. A command that reached out to another system mid-
 * transaction would roll back its own half and leave the account behind.
 *
 * ORDER MATTERS, and it is deliberate: authorize FIRST, create the account
 * SECOND, provision the identity THIRD, and delete the account if the third
 * fails. Creating the account before checking permission would let anyone who
 * can reach this action mint Supabase users; leaving it behind on a failure
 * would accumulate accounts with no person attached.
