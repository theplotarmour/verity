/**
 * The route-loading indicator.
 *
 * Not the shadcn morphing-blob reference this was requested from — that one
 * assumes a project this isn't: `@/lib/utils` `cn()`, `bg-primary`, styled-jsx
 * (none of which exist here; every other component in this folder just
 * concatenates className strings, so this does too). The morph-and-wobble
 * itself was also a harder sell than a plain rotation for a serious ops
 * tool's loading state — Bible V4 keeps motion restrained, and a shape
 * changing identity every 600ms reads as decoration standing in for content,
 * closer to a mascot than a status indicator.
 *
 * What's kept from the brief: size variants, and it answers to the accent —
 * `border-accent` on the moving arc means it repaints for every one of the
 * ten presets with no work here, the same as everything else in the
 * Experience System.
