 * Session refresh at the Next.js request boundary.

 * Authority: implementation/03-platform-foundation/identity.md contract step 2,
 * which names "the Next.js middleware boundary". Next 16 renamed that convention
 * from `middleware` to `proxy` (node_modules/next/dist/docs/01-app/03-api-reference/
 * 03-file-conventions/proxy.md); this is the same boundary under its current name,
 * not a departure from the handoff.
 *
 * This refreshes the Supabase session cookie so Server Components — which cannot
 * write cookies — always observe a valid session. It deliberately performs no
 * authorization: the proxy runs before the platform can resolve a membership,
 * and duplicating permission logic here would create the second permission
 * system the brief forbids. Route protection is the page's own job, through
 * requireActor().

     * Degrading here is safe precisely because this boundary performs no
     * authorization: a request that fails to refresh simply carries no refreshed
     * session, and the page's own requireActor() redirects to sign-in. The
     * failure is logged rather than swallowed, because an operator has to be
     * able to tell a provider outage from users being randomly signed out.
